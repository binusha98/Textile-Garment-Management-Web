	"I am a regular vine apparel customer. Been to the parties, the store, warehouse and shopped online. I keep coming back because of how easy it is to set up my wardrobe. The parties are fantastic fun a great way to shop with friends. The owner and staff are friendly and helpful I always feel welcome at their stores, parties and over the phone. The website is easy to use and the flat postage rate makes it an affordable way to shop. They have great specials and of course I love their clothes and accessories!"</p>

	"I absolutely LOVE Vine Apparel and have been shopping here since they began. Still to this day i wear some of the pieces I purchased years ago which shows how good the quality of the clothes are. Not only are they amazing and on trend, but dealing with the lovely Shelley and the Vine Apparel girls makes the shopping experience so much better. I literally just have to walk in and tell them what I need an outfit for and I’ll have so many options to choose from at prices that just leave me gobsmacked by how affordable they are!"</p>

	We really had a wonderful time at the wedding and have received fabulous feedback from our guests. We want to thank you for making everything look and feel so fantastic and go so smoothly! The whole ‘event’ was just what we had hoped for – chic but relaxed – which left a very memorable impression on both local and overseas guests. Your attention to detail was superb and did not go un-noticed.
